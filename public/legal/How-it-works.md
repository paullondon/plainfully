# How Plainfully Works

Plainfully helps you understand messages, letters, and emails — calmly and clearly.

## Step 1: Send your message
You forward an email or paste text into Plainfully.

## Step 2: We analyse it safely
Your message is processed in a secure system designed to prevent misuse.

## Step 3: You receive a clear explanation
We explain:
- What the message is saying
- What it is asking for
- Whether there are risks to be aware of

## Step 4: View it securely
You receive a private link to view your result.
Only you can access it.

Plainfully is designed to reduce confusion — not add to it.
